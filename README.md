# Front-end at VI Company - Work in Progress

## General

* We follow progressive enhancement as much as possible.
* We highly regard accessibility and Web Standards.
* We support the latest evergreen browsers (but often also older browsers).

## JavaScript (ES6+)

* We write vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Not that we don't like React, Angular or Framework X, but often we don't need it.
* We write modular JS and use and host modules from NPM.
* Our ES6+ code gets transpiled with Browserify and Babel to ES5.
* We use our own [ESLint config](https://github.com/vicompany/eslint-config-vi) to check our code on quality and bugs.

## CSS (Sass)

* We write modular Sass.
* We use [BEM](https://en.bem.info) for class names.
* And a sprinkle of [SMACSS](https://smacss.com) for states.
* And we follow [Atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) as design methodology.
* We use [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io) with our own config for checking our code.

## Tooling

* We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for compiling JS, CSS and other tasks.
* We use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) to share the same basic editor settings.

## Editor plugins
